THE OS SIMULATION PROJECT LICENSE v1.1
LAST UPDATED 10 JAN 2026

This license affects everything we've made except for the iOS 6 Simulator as it uses a different license.

WHAT IS COVERED BY THIS LICENSE:
All original assets created by The OS Simulation Project and contributors, including but not limited to images, audio, video, code, text and models that weren't completely based on things created by other parties.

WHAT IS NOT COVERED BY THIS LICENSE:
Any assets created, copyrighted or under a different license by other parties not involved in this project, such as Microsoft or Apple. This includes assets such as images, audio, video, code and text.
However, you are still free to use the assets that are NOT created by us, but don't be suprised if Microsoft or Apple shoots you down with us... especially if you try to make money off it.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. You are free to do whatever you want with this repository. This includes but is NOT limited to:
- Modification (i.e. making edits to our Roblox experiences)
- Commerical Use/Monetization (However, if you monetize anything not made by us, such as copyrighted assets by Microsoft or Apple, don't expect them to ignore that you did that.)
- Redistribution (i.e. reuploading our YouTube videos, reuploading our Roblox experiences/assets)
